# OGU-Autobumper
Autobumper for OGU threads!

# How to use it?
First off, you need to have Python installed on your system. 
After you have it installed, open a command prompt and type "pip install selenium" and "pip install undetected_chromedriver". Once you have those libraries installed, type "python autobumper.py" and it should all work. You should also have chrome version 104. Chrome version 103 doesn't play nicely with the chromedriver.

Also, don't forget to enter your username, password, and the thread you want bumped into those empty strings around line 30 of the code :D
