## Getting Started
It's recommended to run the script on a Linux desktop or Linux VPS. Also, make sure to have a GUI! The script opens an actual Chrome window which won't work if you don't have a desktop environment or standalone window manager installed. The colours won't work on Windows and it also tends to crash after 1-2 autobumps. Chrome version 104 or 105 is also recommended. Earlier versions of Chrome have issues with crashing. :D 

## Installing
If you don't have Python already installed, you should download version 3.9 (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once Python is installed, you're good to go! You no longer need to install the two external libraries, as those are installed automatically the first time you run the script now. 

## Usage
At around line 35 of the script, there's two empty strings named "username" and "password". Write your OGU username and password between the quotation marks. Your login details are needed so that you're able to login into the site to post an autobump message to the thread! After that, you'll need to scroll down to around line 85. I have three examples down there of how to write the function properly! You can autobump as many threads as you want by just typing the function again and again. If you don't want to put a custom message, the script automatically chooses the thread message "Autobumped using Penderdrill's autobumper". (Remember to indent new lines as spacing is very important in Python.)
