## Getting Started
It's recommended to run the script on a Linux distro or Linux VPS. The colours won't work on Windows and it also tends to crash after 1-2 autobumps.
Chrome version 105 is also recommended. Earlier versions of Chrome have issues with crashing. :D 

## Installing
If you don't have Python already installed, you should download version 3.9 (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once Python is installed, you'll need two external libraries. To download these, open your terminal and type "pip install selenium" and "pip install undetected-chromedriver". 

## Usage
At the top of the script, there's two empty strings named "username" and "password". Write your OGU username and password between the quotation marks. Your login details are needed so that you're able to login into the site to post an autobump message to the thread! After that, you'll need to scroll down to around line 60. I have two examples down there of how to write the function properly! You can either choose to autobump one thread, or a hundred.
